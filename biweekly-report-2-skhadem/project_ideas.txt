From Report 1:
- Visualization of Neural Nets
- Adversarial images - see the "camouflage" shirts made for YOLO
- Rather than simply getting a no-detection, try and get YOLO to detect a different class
- Using adversarial examples as further regularization
-------------------------------
- Sort of crazy idea: Train a model to predict the accuracy of other models: Given an architecture, predict an accuracy on CIFAR-10.
    - Need a way to feature-ize the model's architecture and hyperparams
    - Labels are the performance (error %)
    - Can scrape papers to get this
    - This could then be used to help with hyperparam search. I.e. feed in a few different hyperparam combinations, and get out an accuracy without needing to actually train the new model
- Style transfer on images
    - Want to learn more applications of this, other than just art (which is still cool!)
- Style transfer on audio
    - Could have uses in generating accents, generating better autotune
    - Haven't seen a paper for this
