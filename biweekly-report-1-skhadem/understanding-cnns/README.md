# Further Understanding Convolutional Neural Nets
I have used CNNs in the past, and have a decent understanding of how to get them to work, but I wanted to do a deeper dive into the intricacies of CNNs in general to gain a better understanding. This page serves as a table of contents of sorts, it is a collection of links to other pages in this folder, in the order they were explored.
