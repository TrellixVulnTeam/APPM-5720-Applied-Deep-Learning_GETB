# Adversarial Learning

I have always been fascinated by GANs. In order to start learning about how GANs work, it seems important to begin by getting some background information on adversarial examples in general. Using an OpenAI article as a starting point, I stumbled across some existing libraries that provide implementations of some basic adversarial methods, and spent some time playing around with examples. Again, this is organized roughly in the order it was done.
