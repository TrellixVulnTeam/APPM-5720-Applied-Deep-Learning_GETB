# Biweekly Report 1
## Soroush Khadem

<!-- Plan of attack:
- Read a few articles about CNNs to deeper understand dimensions, maybe work out a few examples by hand
    - Maybe recreate visuals
    - Maybe create own visuals
- Do a quick MNIST start to finish both in tensorflow and in Pytorch
- Watch a video On GANs
    - Recall: Gene Kogan
- Read blog post on GANs
- Learn about Transfer learning
- Start a document for running ideas on Final Project -->

For Report 1, my focus is 100% on exploration. I want to get my feet wet with some more introductory level deep learning, to ensure I have a solid foundation moving forward. I started with Convolutional Neural Nets (to stay relevant to class material) and then branched out to adversarial learning. This report is organized mostly through README files, with some supplemental jupyter notebooks. This way, the viewing of the report is best done through GitHub's web browsing. Below is a evolving list of things I want to get done. Note that any items that I don't finish can serve as starting places for the next report, so they are intentionally included as a reference for myself.

A note on organization: each major item below has a link to the corresponding README within the subfolder, which serves as a table of contents for that section.

- [x] Get more familiar with CNNs [[link](./understanding-cnns/)]
    - [x] Want to clear up some of the main terms and understand how the dimensions work
    - [x] Apply this to some of the popular architectures, ensuring that I understand how to come to the results for the sizes of each layer
    - [x] Write some test code working with MNIST
- [ ] Adversarial Learning [[link](./adversarial-learning/)]
    - [x] Begin to explore what the term means
    - [x] Recreate some results in code - visually
    - [ ] More rigorous coding examples - maybe try to show some confusion matrices
    - [ ] Begin to explore GANs
- [ ] Compare frameworks [[link](./comparing-frameworks/)]
    - [ ] Do research into which framework to pick moving forward. (Maybe a combination?)
    - [ ] Try a few different ones out
- [x] Start a running document to organize ideas on what to focus on for the final project [[link](./project_ideas.txt)]
