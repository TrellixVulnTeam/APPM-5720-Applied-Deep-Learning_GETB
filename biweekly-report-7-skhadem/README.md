# Biweekly Report 7
## Soroush Khadem

This report, I was spent the majority of my time implementing and training a deep network for weakly supervised object detection. My final project will involve weakly supervised object detection, so I wanted to get comfortable with the code tools around this task. Also, in order to continue to think about ways to try out something new in WSOD, I have been reading many papers, and took notes about the key ideas of some. Most likely, I will combine some ideas already out there in the space. In addition, I finally got a Google Cloud VM running.
