# GANs
As I have stated, I want to learn more about how GANs work. I had a few videos/blogs lined up to learn more, but only ended up watching half of one.

- Notes on Goodfellow talk [here](./intro-to-gans.md)

I want to continue to ramp up the work on GANs week by week, so going from nothing to at least part of a video this week was a success in my book.
