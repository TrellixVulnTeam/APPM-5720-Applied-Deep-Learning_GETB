# Attention Networks
As I mentioned last report, I am finding myself focusing more and more on attention networks. The idea of using attention post-mordem to see what the network is doing, as well as the idea of learning attention to improve performance or even to perform weakly supervised segmentation or localization really draws me in and excites me. I skimmed quite a few papers, and settled on the paper "Learn to Pay Attention" as the one I wanted to dive into further.
