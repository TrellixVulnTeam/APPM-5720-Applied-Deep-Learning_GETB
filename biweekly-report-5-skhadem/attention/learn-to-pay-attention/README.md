# [Learn To Pay Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02391.pdf)

When reading about attention networks, one of the papers that consistently had many citations and references was this paper, called "Learn to Pay Attention". As the name suggests, the paper deals with learned attention modules. The novelty og the paper is that the attention modules measure how closely the "local" features (i.e. parts of feature maps) agree with the "global" features (i.e. the final feature map before the classification task). The paper reported really good performance compared to baseline (7% on CIFAR-100) so I decided to dive deeper into it.
